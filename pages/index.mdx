# Welcome to MotorGo

MotorGo is a line of motor controllers designed to minimize the time from idea to prototype for your robotics projects. We have motor controllers that are suited for every step of your robotics journey, whether you're building your first rover or you're designing a prototype for your next research project. Not only that, the user experience is consistent across all of the motor controllers, so that upgrading to the next tier is as simple as swapping out your hardware.
