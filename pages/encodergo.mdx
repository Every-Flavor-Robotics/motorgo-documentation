# EncoderGo

## Key Features

* **14-bit Resolution** - The MT6701 magnetic encoder provides 16384 counts per revolution.
* **SPI Interface** - Communicate with the encoder over SPI, with the 5-pin EncoderGo JST connector.

## Magnetic Encoders

Magnetic encoders work differently from optical encoders:

- **Detection Method**: They use the rotation of a magnet to detect position instead of a light source and photodetector.
- **Advantages**: More compact and offer higher resolution compared to optical encoders.

## Setting Up EncoderGo

<Steps>

### Attach the Magnet
   Attach a **diametrically magnetized magnet** to the motor shaft or any rotating part you want to measure. We have a 3D-printable magnet holder available on our [Printables page](https://www.printables.com/@MotorGoLLC_1533058).

### Mount the Encoder
   - Place the encoder as close to the magnet as possible.
   - Ensure the magnet is **centered on the encoder IC** located in the middle of the EncoderGo board.
   - 3D-printable encoder mounts are available on our [Printables page](https://www.printables.com/@MotorGoLLC_1533058).

### Connect the Encoder
    Connect the EncoderGo to your MotorGo board using the 5-pin JST connector. You should see the encoder LED light up when the MotorGo is powered on.
</Steps>

## EncoderGo Connector Pinout

The EncoderGo port exposes the encoder SPI interface and power pins. You can break out the pins to a custom connector or use the EncoderGo cable to connect to the MotorGo board.
