# Installing Board Definitions

The first step to programming your MotorGo board is to install the board definitions in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO. The MotorGo boards are released in two stages: Experimental and Production. The board definitions for Experimental boards are stored in the MotorGo Experimental Boards repository, while the production board definitions are directly available in the `esp32 by espressif systems` board definition package. The table below shows the current status of the MotorGo boards:

## Installing Experimental Board Definitions

To install the MotorGo Experimental Boards, you will need to add the MotorGo Experimental Boards URL to the Arduino IDE. Follow the instructions below to install the Experimental Boards:

1. Open the Arduino IDE
2. Go to `File > Preferences` or `Arduino > Preferences` on macOS
3. In the `Additional Boards Manager URLs` field, add the following URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Every-Flavor-Robotics/motorgo-experimental-boards/refs/heads/main/package_motorgo_index.json`
4. Click `OK` to save the preferences
5. Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager...`
6. Search for `MotorGo Experimental`
7. Install the `MotorGo Experimental` boards

## Installing Production Board Definitions

To install the MotorGo Production Boards, you will need to install the `esp32 by espressif systems` board definitions. Follow the instructions below to install the Production Boards:

1. Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager...`
2. Search for `ESP32`
3. Install `esp32` by Espressif Systems

After installing the board definitions, you should be able to select your MotorGo from the list of available boards in the Arduino IDE.

Proceed to the [Installing the MotorGo Library](/standalone_mode/library_setup) guide to install the MotorGo library for your board.
