The Plink Python API supports any Debian-based Linux distribution for the Pi (Ubuntu, Raspbian, Debian, etc). We recommend using the official Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit).

If you already have a Raspberry Pi set up, you can skip this step and go directly to the [next step](/pihat_mode/motorgo_setup).

## MotorGo Raspberry Pi Image Installation

### Installing the MotorGo Raspberry Pi Image

<Steps>
#### Install the Raspberry Pi Imager on your computer

The Raspberry Pi Imager is available for download [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).

#### Flash the image to an SD card
* Insert the SD card into your computer
* Open the Raspberry Pi Imager
* Select your Pi model in the `Choose Device` menu
* Select `Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)` in the `Choose OS` menu and choose the MotorGo image
* Choose your SD card in the `Choose SD Card` menu
* Apply OS customization settings
    * Configure SSH access if needed
    * Configure the WiFi settings if needed
* Click `Write` and wait for the process to complete
</Steps>

{/* ### Connecting the Pi to your network
Once you power up the Raspberry Pi with the MotorGo image, you will need to connect the Pi to your network. There are two ways to do this:

1. **Ethernet**: Connect the Pi to your router with an Ethernet cable. Go to your router's admin page to find the IP address of the Pi.

2.  **WiFi**: When not connected to the network, the Pi will create a WiFi network called `motorgo-pi-XXXX`. Connect to this network and go to `http://setup.motorgo.local` in your browser to configure the WiFi settings.
 */}


### Connecting to the Raspberry Pi

Once the Pi is connected, you can access it via SSH or VNC.

{/* The default username is `motorgo` and the default password is `motorgo`. */}

#### SSH
* Open a terminal on your computer
* Run `ssh motorgo@<ip_address>` where `<ip_address>` is the IP address of the Pi

#### VNC
* Download a VNC client on your computer. We recommend [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/)
* Open the VNC client and enter the IP address of the Pi
* Enter the username and password when prompted

The Raspberry Pi is now set up and ready to use with the MotorGo Plink, continue to the next step to setup the Plink as a PiHat.
