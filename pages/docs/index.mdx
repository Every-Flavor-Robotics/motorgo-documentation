# Welcome to MotorGo

MotorGo minimizes the time from idea to prototype for your robotics projects. We make robot controllers suited for every step of your journey, whether spinning your first motor or designing actuators for the next research project. MotorGo software is consistent across the ecosystem. Upgrading to the next tier is as simple as swapping out your hardware.
