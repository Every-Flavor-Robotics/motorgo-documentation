# MotorGo Mini 1

## Description

The MotorGo Mini is the first MotorGo ever made, providing state-of-the-art brushless motor control in a compact footprint.

MotorGo is an all-in-one solution for brushless and brushed motor control. It enables operation in closed-loop position and velocity control mode using Field Oriented Control (FOC) with built-in wireless-enable microcontroller.

## Basic Specifications
