# Configure the Plink for PiHat mode

To operate as a PiHat, the Plink must be flashed with the PiHat firmware. The Pi can do this automatically through the `motorgo` command line tool, which is a part of the `motorgo` Python package.

## Connecting the Plink to the Pi

To connect the Plink to the Pi, use the 40-pin header on the Pi.

## Installing the motorgo python package

The `motorgo` package is available on PyPi and can be installed with pip.

```bash filename="bash"
pip install motorgo
```

### Manual Installation

If you would like to install the package manually, you can clone the repository and install it with pip.

```bash filename="bash"
git clone
cd motorgo
pip install .
```

## Flashing the PiHat firmware

Installing the PiHat firmware is as simple as running the following command:

```bash filename="bash"
motorgo flash
```

This will automatically pull the correct version of the firmware and flash it to the Plink via the GPIO pins.


## Custom Firmware
The PiHat firmware is open source and can be modified to suit your needs. The firmware is available on GitHub and can be found [here](/broken-link). The firmware is written in Arduino and can be flashed using either PlatformIO or the Arduino IDE. Follow the [standalone setup](/motorgo_plink_1/standalone) to configure your development environment.
