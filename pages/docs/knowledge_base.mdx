## Get your bearings 

Learning robotics can be overwhelming without the right map. At MotorGo, we use five widely accepted categories as building blocks for robotics.


## The 5 Core Areas:

### Brains (Computation) :brain:

This is where robots *think* and make decisions. Things like algorithms, data management, and motor control decisions all start in Computation. 

### Energy (Power Management) :zap:

Just like muscles need energy to move, robots need power to function. Power Management covers things like battery management, voltage regulation, and safe power distribution. 

### Senses (Sensing) :eyes:

Like humans, robots perceive their environment to inform their decisions. This involves sensors like cameras, rangefinders, and thermocouples. Sensors allow robots to "see" and "hear" what's around them. 

### Messaging (Communication) :satellite:

Robots need a way to "speak" and "listen" to other devices or systems. This includes Bluetooth and WiFi, as well as protocols like UART, I2C, and SPI. Fast, reliable Communication makes integration possible.  

### Movement (Actuation) :muscle:

Finally, Actuation is how a robot *moves* and *interacts* with the world. This includes a range of tools that generally convert electrical power into some kind of mechanical power - motors, pumps, and pneumatics to name a few. 


## Beyond the docs 

Robotics is a big field. Take a look at our Map of Robotics page for more practical steps on what to study to get into robotics and how to avoid overwhelm/burnout as you go.
