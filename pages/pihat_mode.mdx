# MotorGo as a PiHat

<Callout type="info" emoji="🤖">
    Applies to Plink, Axis
</Callout>

The MotorGo Plink and Core can be configured as a PiHat for use with any Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. In this configuration, the MotorGo Plink 1 can be controlled using the Python API.



This page should serve as an introduction of sorts to this configuration. Details to include could be:
* Features of the MotorGo Plink 1 in PiHat mode
* Why you would want to use the MotorGo Plink 1 as a PiHat vs in standalone mode
* Link to using ROS with Plink PiHat


This callout might need a better home. I'm not sure where it should go, maybe this is the right page, if we add more info here

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

    Heatsinks on the Raspberry Pi may short connectors on the bottom of the MotorGo Plink 1. Please use longer standoffs and a header spacer to prevent this.
