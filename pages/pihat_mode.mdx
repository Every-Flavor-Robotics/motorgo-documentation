# MotorGo as a PiHat

<Callout type="info" emoji="🤖">
    Applies to Plink, Axis
</Callout>

The MotorGo Plink and Core can be configured as a PiHat for use with any Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. In this configuration, the MotorGo boards can be controlled using the MotorGo Python API.

If you're familiar with the setup process for a Raspberry Pi, jump to the [Quickstart Guide](/pihat_mode/quickstart) to get started. Otherwise, follow the detailed setup instructions, starting at [Raspberry Pi Setup](/pihat_mode/pi_setup).


{/* This page should serve as an introduction of sorts to this configuration. Details to include could be:
* Features of the MotorGo Plink 1 in PiHat mode
* Why you would want to use the MotorGo Plink 1 as a PiHat vs in standalone mode
* Link to using ROS with Plink PiHat


This callout might need a better home. I'm not sure where it should go, maybe this is the right page, if we add more info here */}

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

    The MotorGo Python API does not currently support the Axis, meaning it can't be used in PiHat mode yet. Support is on the way!
