    title="IMU"
    description="IMU provides the data from the onboard IMU on the MotorGo board.

    The IMU class provides access to the gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data from the onboard IMU. This class
    also automatically provides AHRS filtering to calculate the orientation of the board. This allows you to direftly access
    the orientation of the board as a quaternion or gravity vector. The class provides all of its data as properties, so you
    can access the data directly without needing to call functions.

    Attributes:
        gyro (np.ndarray): The gyroscope data as a numpy array [x, y, z].
        accel (np.ndarray): The accelerometer data as a numpy array [x, y, z].
        mag (np.ndarray): The magnetometer data as a numpy array [x, y, z].
        gravity_vector (np.ndarray): The gravity vector calculated by the AHRS filter as a numpy array [x, y, z].
        quaternion (np.ndarray): The quaternion calculated by the AHRS filter as a numpy array [w, x, y, z]."
