# Controlling Motors

Each motor channel can be controlled by it's corresponding `MotorChannel` object in the `Plink` object. The `MotorChannel` objects can be accessed as:

```python filename="python"
plink.channel1
plink.channel2
plink.channel3
plink.channel4
```


You can save a reference to the `MotorChannel` objects as local variables for convenience. For example:

```python filename="python"
left_drive_wheel = plink.channel1
right_drive_wheel = plink.channel2
```

## Voltage Limits

To protect the motors, each motor channel has a voltage limit that is set to 0.0 by default. The voltage limit for each channel must be set when initially connecting to the Plink to match the voltage limit of your motors. The example below shows how to modify the initialization code to set the motor voltage limits.

```python filename="python"

from motorgo import Plink

# Create a Plink object, the main interface to the MotorGo board
plink = Plink()

# Set the power supply voltage
plink.power_supply_voltage = 9.0

left_drive_wheel = plink.channel1
right_drive_wheel = plink.channel2

# Set the motor voltage limit for each motor channel
left_motor.motor_voltage_limit = 5.0
right_motor.motor_voltage_limit = 5.0
plink.channel3.motor_voltage_limit = 5.0
plink.channel4.motor_voltage_limit = 5.0

# Finally, connect to the MotorGo board and push the configuration
plink.connect()
```

## Motor Control Modes

The Plink supports two motor control modes: `ControlMode.POWER` and `ControlMode.VELOCITY`.

### Power Control Mode
In power control mode, the motor is controlled by directly setting the power level. The power level is a value between -1.0 and 1.0, where -1.0 is full reverse, 0.0 is stopped, and 1.0 is full forward. To configure a motor channel to power control mode, set the `control_mode` attribute of the `MotorChannel` object to `ControlMode.POWER`.

```python filename="python"
from motorgo import ControlMode

left_drive_wheel.control_mode = ControlMode.POWER
```

To set the power level of the motor, set the `power` attribute of the `MotorChannel` object to a value between -1.0 and 1.0.

```python filename="python"
left_drive_wheel.power = 0.5
```

### Velocity Control Mode
In velocity control mode, the motor is controlled by setting the desired velocity in rad/s. To configure a motor channel to velocity control mode, set the `control_mode` attribute of the `MotorChannel` object to `ControlMode.VELOCITY`.

```python filename="python"
from motorgo import ControlMode

left_drive_wheel.control_mode = ControlMode.VELOCITY
```

Next, you must configure the velocity PID controller parameters for the motor:

```python filename="python"
left_drive_wheel.set_velocity_pid_gains(p = 1.0, i = 0.0, d = 0.0, output_ramp = None, lpf = None)
```

The `output_ramp` can be set to limit the rate of change of the motor power output. The `lpf` parameter can be set to apply a low-pass filter to the velocity setpoint. You can set any of the parameters to `None` to use the default values.

Finally, set the desired velocity of the motor by setting the `velocity` attribute of the `MotorChannel` object to the desired velocity in rad/s.

```python filename="python"
left_drive_wheel.velocity = 1.0
```

If the motor seems to be spinning at the top speed regardless of the velocity setpoint, you may need to flip the sign of the PID gains, as the motor may be spinning in the opposite direction of the encoder.
