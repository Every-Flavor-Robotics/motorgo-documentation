# MotorGo Plink 1 as a PiHat

The MotorGo Plink can be configured as a PiHat for use with any Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. In this configuration, the MotorGo Plink 1 can be controlled using the Python API.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

    Heatsinks on the Raspberry Pi may short connectors on the bottom of the MotorGo Plink 1. Please use longer standoffs and a header spacer to prevent this.
</Callout>

This page should serve as an introduction of sorts to this configuration. Details to include could be:
* Features of the MotorGo Plink 1 in PiHat mode
* Why you would want to use the MotorGo Plink 1 as a PiHat vs in standalone mode
* Link to using ROS with Plink PiHat
